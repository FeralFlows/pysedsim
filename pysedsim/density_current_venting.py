'''

Module to define the Density Current Venting class and asssociated methods.

This class represents the density current venting technique for routing sediment through a reservoir. Class instances (objects) become
stored in reservoir instances as part of its operating policy. Hence, this class contains methods for determining whether density current
venting will happen at a reservoir on a given day, definition of required reservoir water level targets, distribution of flow among
outlets to achieve those elevation targets, and mass balance calculations for the reservoir.
